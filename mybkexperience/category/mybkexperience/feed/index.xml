<p>Let&#8217;s prepare some spaghetti at home! You can make it right now if you have flour, two eggs, a little olive oil, and salt. To produce excellent handmade pasta, you don&#8217;t need special Italian pasta flours, and it&#8217;s okay if you don&#8217;t have a pasta maker. Using a simple rolling pin and your hands, you can produce pasta. I frequently make pasta at home, and this is now my go-to &#8220;everyday&#8221; recipe. It produces a wonderful, adaptable dough that you can roll out and shape into different types of noodles.</p>
<p>This <a href="/mybkexperience-survey/">page</a> contains my basic pasta dough and process. The fundamentals. Aside from that, I&#8217;m going to give you a good earful. I&#8217;ll go over some variations and considerations further down. I&#8217;ll also include step-by-step photos of the pasta dough-making process. You can make it by hand, stand maker, or pasta maker. Homemade <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pasta&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN987IN987&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsb85Yn05o8PwbVbKXE5KGpvhla05w:1669214744257&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi294m_xcT7AhVJS2wGHaXiBbUQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=789&amp;dpr=2">pasta</a> recipe is one of my absolute favourite things to make, and I&#8217;ve compiled everything I&#8217;ve learned about it over the years into this single post, complete with links to my favourite resources. This is an ongoing journey for me, so I&#8217;ll keep you updated. Have fun and happy pasta making!</p>
<p><strong>How to Make Eggless Pasta</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure many of you will want to know how to make eggless pasta or vegan pasta dough. No worries. I make a dough similar to this for one of my favourite pasta shapes, pici. Essentially, you cut 1/4-inch strips of dough and roll them out by hand. Eggless doughs like this are typically used for shapes like pici, cavatelli, trofie, and orecchiette rather than pasta noodles like the others we&#8217;re focusing on today. To make eggless pasta dough, follow these steps: 200g &#8220;00&#8221; flour, 200g semolina flour, 200g warm water, and 1 teaspoon fine grain sea salt are combined. Use these ingredients and follow the &#8220;How to Make Pasta By Hand&#8221; instructions in the book.</p>

<p><em><strong>About French Fry.</strong></em></p>

It&#8217;s these bitsy crisp bubbles that increase the face area of the shindig, making it redundant brickle immaculately, this subcaste should only be as thick as it needs to be to add terseness. Any thicker, and you start running into tough home.</p>
<p>Fries that are too dark or are spotty have an off putting burnt flavor that distracts from the potato. Light golden but perfectly crisp is how I want my <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thespruceeats.com%2Fthmb%2FIHKuXcx3uUI1IWkM_cnnQdFH-zQ%3D%2F3485x2323%2Ffilters%3Afill(auto%2C1)%2Fhow-to-make-homemade-french-fries-2215971-hero-01-02f62a016f3e4aa4b41d0c27539885c3.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thespruceeats.com%2Fhow-to-make-homemade-french-fries-2215971&amp;tbnid=bpeNNisSx3EOwM&amp;vet=12ahUKEwiNiISBscD6AhWqk9gFHe2hBL8QMygCegUIARCBAg..i&amp;docid=k12DzLe5Upr0sM&amp;w=3485&amp;h=2323&amp;q=french%20fry&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNiISBscD6AhWqk9gFHe2hBL8QMygCegUIARCBAg">fries</a> to be.</p>
<p>Like all shops and creatures, potatoes are composed of cells. These cells are held together by pectin, a form of sugar that acts as a type of cement. These cells also contain bounce grains bitsy sacs that act water balloons, as well as simple sugars. When these bounce grains are exposed to water and heat, they begin to swell, ultimately bursting, and releasing a shower of blown bounce motes. Now the problem is, in order to get the ideal crust, all three of these rudiments must be in the proper balance, and the proper state. Too numerous simple sugars, and your <a href="/mybkexperience-survey/">potato</a> will brown long before it crisps. However, your potatoes will either fail to form a crust, will fall piecemeal before it gets a chance to, If pectin has broken down too much before the bounce grains have had a chance to burst and release their sticky innards.</p>

<p>Without representing any grievances about the state of ground beef, the key to a perfect cheeseburger comes straight from the botcher. We got ours courtesy of Dickson’s Farmstand Flesh, and boy was it beautiful to behold. Neither muddy nor pink, this natural, humanely raised and yet not lawn- fed coarsely ground chuck was a fresh, bright lustrous red, and an absolute pleasure to handle. Or perhaps Jess just really loves raw meat, as demonstrated in our forthcoming “ How to Shape Burger galettes. ”</p>
<p>The All- American Cheese<a href="/">burger</a> has certainnon-negotiable rudiments American rubbish is one of them. Rather than unwrap individual mates, get sliced rubbish from your nearest deli counter — it tastes better and melts slower and further unevenly. Dill fix chips, sliced red onion and tomato, crisp lettuce leaves, ketchup and mayo are also involved. You can mix indeed the two seasonings together along with some diced pickles for Thousand Island dressing, a burger fave, and it ’ll still be an each- <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/food/recipes/american-cheeseburger">American Cheeseburger</a> worth Instagramming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BEST Homemade Pizza</strong> recipe</h1>
<p>This is the BEST homemade pizza recipe. You&#8217;ll be craving this pizza weekly! Learn my tips and tricks, and you&#8217;ll be baking pizza like a pro in no time! Preparing this perfect homemade pizza recipe is inexpensive and in my opinion the taste and quality of the ingredients are better than buying a pizza from a chain pizzeria. This recipe costs about $7.22, makes two 14 inch cakes and serves 6 to 8 people. That&#8217;s only $1.20 a serving! Nothing beats pizza night. For more fun pizza options, try this Strawberry Balsamic Bacon Pizza, this Dessert Fruit Pizza!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to make the perfect homemade pizza for years! I&#8217;ve been playing with the <a href="/2021/11/02/burger-king-just-added-a-new-burger-to-their-1-menu/">recipe</a> for a while. Today I bring you Pepperoni Pizza Perfection! Yesterday I posted my favourite pizza dough recipe. with the methods, tips and tricks that I have learned over the years of preparation. Last week I posted my copycat pizza place pizza sauce recipe, and today I&#8217;m bringing it all together with this homemade pizza recipe!</p>
<p>First prepare the recipe for the pizza dough. Place a <a href="https://www.dominos.co.in/">pizza</a> stone in the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees for 30 minutes. Next, place parchment paper on the pizza peel and sprinkle cornmeal on top. Peel the pizza, press the dough into a 14-inch circle, and brush the outer edge of the dough with olive oil.</p>
<p>Place two paper towels on a microwave-safe plate, spread the pepperoni evenly on the plate, and cover with two more paper towels. Kitchen towels for 30 seconds.Use the top paper towels to soak up any excess fat and set aside. Now spread the pizza sauce on the pizza dough. Then sprinkle parmesan over the dough, followed by mozzarella and pepperoni slices. Finally push the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone with the pizza peel. Bake for 8-12 minutes.Let the pizza rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat with the dough and remaining ingredients.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>What went wrong? Whoppers cost the Carrols Restaurant Group $8 million in sales.</strong></em></p>
<p>Carrols Restaurant Group is one of the largest <a href="/">Burger King</a> franchisees in the country. It operates more than 1,000 branches out of a total of around 7,500 Burger King branches. an important way. What happened? This is how it happened:Burger King ran a promotion offering discounts on Whopper and Whopper Jr. sandwiches. Most locations offered 2 <a href="https://www.burgerking.co.uk/menu/picker-23d38263-8347-4ddc-aec0-a738c3cc6578">Whopper</a> Jr. for $4, 2 Whopper for $5, and 2 Double Whopper for $6. When customers asked for any of these offerings, the cashier would try to sell them and see if they&#8217;d like to add fries or a drink to their meal.</p>
<p>When a customer bought fries and a drink, an additional &#8220;Whopper Combo Meal&#8221; discount was added alongside the previous Whopper promotion. food.This combination of discounts resulted in an extremely low price for groceries, which severely impacted the profitability of Carrols Restaurant Group.</p>
<p>Because two different promotional discounts were combined when they shouldn&#8217;t have been, Carrols Restaurant Group lost money. A lot of money. After accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the company&#8217;s earnings declined by $7.3 million.</p>
<p>In the quarter in which this incident occurred, Carrols Restaurant Group reported a net loss of $6.8 million (15 cents a share) compared to a net income of $3.6 million in the same quarter last year. The bug was first discovered in late August. Carrols found his store&#8217;s sales increased by just 4%.5%, which was below Burger King&#8217;s overall comparable growth of 5%.</p>
<p>Carrols typically outpaces the growth of other <a href="/mybkexperience-survey/">Burger King</a> franchisees, so they did their research. The problem was discovered in late August and the bug started in early June when the Whopper discount campaign was first launched. It was quickly fixed, but the damage was already done. In total, nearly $8 million in profits were lost as a result of this &#8220;double discount&#8221; on the Burger King Whopper sandwich.</p>

<p>The journey began years ago as a long-term strategy to eliminate colors, flavors, and preservatives from grilled burgers, artisanal chicken, and other products. &#8220;We know our guests&#8217; expectations are changing and they want to make decisions that they are comfortable with,&#8221; said Ellie Doty, CMO of Burger King North America, in a statement. By banning these 120 ingredients from our food, we offer our guests an easy option: delicious food with high-quality ingredients.</p>
<p>We are confident that our continued commitment to real food will not only provide diners with the food they want but will also set a standard for the entire industry. In February 2020, Burger King made headlines for Mold on Whopper Sandwich with an ad showing the removal of the video showing the number of days since the sandwich was made and then showing &#8220;The Beauty of Artificial Preservatives&#8221; on the Screen. , the brand announced that it has been removing man-made colors, flavors, and preservatives from Whopper sandwiches in all U.S. markets worldwide. For a limited time, <a href="/">Burger King</a> put the Whopper in special packaging that showed the recipe with real ingredients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-55 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/mybkexperience.website/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/burger-king.jpg?resize=1024%2C602&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="602" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/mybkexperience.website/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/burger-king.jpg?resize=1024%2C602&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/mybkexperience.website/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/burger-king.jpg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/mybkexperience.website/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/burger-king.jpg?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/mybkexperience.website/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/burger-king.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To celebrate the abolition of 120 artificial ingredients, the chain Keep it Real Meals is launching a campaign in which celebrities choose foods that are &#8220;worthy of their real names&#8221;. For example, Grammy-winning artist Nelly created the Cornell Haynes Jr. menu, which serves the Whopper with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and ketchup along with french fries and a small sprite.</p>
<p>In addition, the Brazilian singer Anitta formulated the Larissa Machado Meal, and the social media personality Lil Huddy formed the Chase Hudson Meal. Keep it Real temporary meals will be available in participating restaurants across the country starting September 12th. Members of the recently launched Royal Perks Loyalty Program can purchase any of the meals for $ 6. Keep it Real Meal boxes also contain a QR code that customers can scan to unlock &#8220;fun and innovative ways to interact with the brand.&#8221;</p>
