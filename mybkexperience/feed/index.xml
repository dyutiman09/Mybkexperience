<p>Once upon a time, Colonel Sanders had a secret recipe for a mouth-watering <a href="/mybkexperience-survey/">burger</a> that he had perfected over the years. The recipe included 11 herbs and spices, but no one knew what they were.</p>
<p>One day, a young chef named Ron discovered the recipe while cleaning out the basement of an old <a href="https://online.kfc.co.in/">KFC</a> restaurant. He was amazed by the unique blend of flavors and decided to recreate the burger.</p>
<p>Ron worked tirelessly, experimenting with different ingredients and cooking techniques until he finally replicated the burger exactly as the Colonel had intended. He presented it to his bosses at KFC, who were blown away by its deliciousness.</p>
<p>The burger became an instant hit with customers, who flocked to KFC to try the secret recipe for themselves. It was unlike anything they had ever tasted before, and soon, KFC&#8217;s sales skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Ron&#8217;s discovery of the secret recipe had transformed KFC&#8217;s fortunes, and he became a hero in the company. He was promoted to head chef and given free rein to experiment with new recipes, which he continued to do for many years.</p>
<p>To this day, the KFC burger remains a beloved fast food staple, enjoyed by millions around the world. And although the secret recipe is still a closely guarded secret, one thing is certain: its unique blend of herbs and spices is what makes it truly special.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s prepare some spaghetti at home! You can make it right now if you have flour, two eggs, a little olive oil, and salt. To produce excellent handmade pasta, you don&#8217;t need special Italian pasta flours, and it&#8217;s okay if you don&#8217;t have a pasta maker. Using a simple rolling pin and your hands, you can produce pasta. I frequently make pasta at home, and this is now my go-to &#8220;everyday&#8221; recipe. It produces a wonderful, adaptable dough that you can roll out and shape into different types of noodles.</p>
<p>This <a href="/mybkexperience-survey/">page</a> contains my basic pasta dough and process. The fundamentals. Aside from that, I&#8217;m going to give you a good earful. I&#8217;ll go over some variations and considerations further down. I&#8217;ll also include step-by-step photos of the pasta dough-making process. You can make it by hand, stand maker, or pasta maker. Homemade <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pasta&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN987IN987&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsb85Yn05o8PwbVbKXE5KGpvhla05w:1669214744257&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi294m_xcT7AhVJS2wGHaXiBbUQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=789&amp;dpr=2">pasta</a> recipe is one of my absolute favourite things to make, and I&#8217;ve compiled everything I&#8217;ve learned about it over the years into this single post, complete with links to my favourite resources. This is an ongoing journey for me, so I&#8217;ll keep you updated. Have fun and happy pasta making!</p>
<p><strong>How to Make Eggless Pasta</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure many of you will want to know how to make eggless pasta or vegan pasta dough. No worries. I make a dough similar to this for one of my favourite pasta shapes, pici. Essentially, you cut 1/4-inch strips of dough and roll them out by hand. Eggless doughs like this are typically used for shapes like pici, cavatelli, trofie, and orecchiette rather than pasta noodles like the others we&#8217;re focusing on today. To make eggless pasta dough, follow these steps: 200g &#8220;00&#8221; flour, 200g semolina flour, 200g warm water, and 1 teaspoon fine grain sea salt are combined. Use these ingredients and follow the &#8220;How to Make Pasta By Hand&#8221; instructions in the book.</p>

<p><em><strong>About French Fry.</strong></em></p>
<p>In order to achieve this terseness, the face structure of a shindig must be riddled withmicro-bubbles. It&#8217;s these bitsy crisp bubbles that increase the face area of the shindig, making it redundant brickle immaculately, this subcaste should only be as thick as it needs to be to add terseness. Any thicker, and you start running into tough home.</p>
<p>Fries that are too dark or are spotty have an off putting burnt flavor that distracts from the potato. Light golden but perfectly crisp is how I want my <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thespruceeats.com%2Fthmb%2FIHKuXcx3uUI1IWkM_cnnQdFH-zQ%3D%2F3485x2323%2Ffilters%3Afill(auto%2C1)%2Fhow-to-make-homemade-french-fries-2215971-hero-01-02f62a016f3e4aa4b41d0c27539885c3.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thespruceeats.com%2Fhow-to-make-homemade-french-fries-2215971&amp;tbnid=bpeNNisSx3EOwM&amp;vet=12ahUKEwiNiISBscD6AhWqk9gFHe2hBL8QMygCegUIARCBAg..i&amp;docid=k12DzLe5Upr0sM&amp;w=3485&amp;h=2323&amp;q=french%20fry&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNiISBscD6AhWqk9gFHe2hBL8QMygCegUIARCBAg">fries</a> to be.</p>
<p>Like all shops and creatures, potatoes are composed of cells. These cells are held together by pectin, a form of sugar that acts as a type of cement. These cells also contain bounce grains bitsy sacs that act water balloons, as well as simple sugars. When these bounce grains are exposed to water and heat, they begin to swell, ultimately bursting, and releasing a shower of blown bounce motes. Now the problem is, in order to get the ideal crust, all three of these rudiments must be in the proper balance, and the proper state. Too numerous simple sugars, and your <a href="/mybkexperience-survey/">potato</a> will brown long before it crisps. However, your potatoes will either fail to form a crust, will fall piecemeal before it gets a chance to, If pectin has broken down too much before the bounce grains have had a chance to burst and release their sticky innards.</p>
<p><em><strong>French Fry recipe</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul class="mntl-structured-ingredients__list">
<li class="mntl-structured-ingredients__list-item " data-id="4442"><span data-ingredient-quantity="true">1</span> <span data-ingredient-unit="true">large</span> <span data-ingredient-name="true">russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</span></li>

<p><strong>Step-1</strong></p>
<p>Soak potato strips in a large coliseum of water for about 30 twinkles. Pat with paper apkins until completely dry.</p>
<p><strong>Step-2</strong></p>
<p>Heat OilPainting in a deep- range or large saucepan to 275 degrees F( 135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil painting and shindig for about 5 twinkles, stirring and flipping the potatoes sometimes. Use a slotted ladle to transfer potatoes to a paper kerchief- lined plate. Let cool fully.</p>
<p><strong>Step-3</strong></p>
<p>Heat OilPainting again, but this time to 350 degrees F( 175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a alternate time until golden brown, 5 to 6 twinkles.</p>

<p>Without representing any grievances about the state of ground beef, the key to a perfect cheeseburger comes straight from the botcher. We got ours courtesy of Dickson’s Farmstand Flesh, and boy was it beautiful to behold. Neither muddy nor pink, this natural, humanely raised and yet not lawn- fed coarsely ground chuck was a fresh, bright lustrous red, and an absolute pleasure to handle. Or perhaps Jess just really loves raw meat, as demonstrated in our forthcoming “ How to Shape Burger galettes. ”</p>
<p>The All- American Cheese<a href="/">burger</a> has certainnon-negotiable rudiments American rubbish is one of them. Rather than unwrap individual mates, get sliced rubbish from your nearest deli counter — it tastes better and melts slower and further unevenly. Dill fix chips, sliced red onion and tomato, crisp lettuce leaves, ketchup and mayo are also involved.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BEST Homemade Pizza</strong> recipe</h1>
<p>This is the BEST homemade pizza recipe. You&#8217;ll be craving this pizza weekly! Learn my tips and tricks, and you&#8217;ll be baking pizza like a pro in no time! Preparing this perfect homemade pizza recipe is inexpensive and in my opinion the taste and quality of the ingredients are better than buying a pizza from a chain pizzeria. This recipe costs about $7.22, makes two 14 inch cakes and serves 6 to 8 people. That&#8217;s only $1.20 a serving! Nothing beats pizza night. For more fun pizza options, try this Strawberry Balsamic Bacon Pizza, this Dessert Fruit Pizza!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to make the perfect homemade pizza for years! I&#8217;ve been playing with the <a href="/2021/11/02/burger-king-just-added-a-new-burger-to-their-1-menu/">recipe</a> for a while. Today I bring you Pepperoni Pizza Perfection! Yesterday I posted my favourite pizza dough recipe. with the methods, tips and tricks that I have learned over the years of preparation. Last week I posted my copycat pizza place pizza sauce recipe, and today I&#8217;m bringing it all together with this homemade pizza recipe!</p>
<p>First prepare the recipe for the pizza dough. Place a <a href="https://www.dominos.co.in/">pizza</a> stone in the oven and preheat the oven to 500 degrees for 30 minutes. Next, place parchment paper on the pizza peel and sprinkle cornmeal on top. Peel the pizza, press the dough into a 14-inch circle, and brush the outer edge of the dough with olive oil.</p>
<p>Place two paper towels on a microwave-safe plate, spread the pepperoni evenly on the plate, and cover with two more paper towels. Kitchen towels for 30 seconds.Use the top paper towels to soak up any excess fat and set aside. Now spread the pizza sauce on the pizza dough. Then sprinkle parmesan over the dough, followed by mozzarella and pepperoni slices. Finally push the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone with the pizza peel. Bake for 8-12 minutes.Let the pizza rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat with the dough and remaining ingredients.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Best Beef for Stovetop Burgers</h1>
<p>After messing around adding this and that to ground beef in my quest to make a better burger, I finally realized that it really is all about the meat. Buy good meat and you will have a great hamburger. It&#8217;s that simple. (Also, keep an eye out for good quality ground beef offerings &#8211; you can stock up and freeze the formed burgers for later meals.</p>
<p>The ideal ground beef for burgers should be 80% lean and 20% lean, but often 85% lean and I think that still makes great burgers.Avoid anything with less than 90% fat &#8211; these burgers can easily get dry and crumbly.</p>
<p>If possible, buy fresh ground beef from the butcher. Not only does it tend to be a bit fresher than corned beef, but it&#8217;s also less compressed. A light hand results in a tender <a href="/2021/11/02/burger-king-just-added-a-new-burger-to-their-1-menu/">burger</a>. Don&#8217;t worry if you only have frozen beef you can still make a decent burger this way.We have some tips and tricks for defrosting ground beef.</p>
<p>How to Form and Shape Patties Perhaps more than the fat content or quality of the meat, I&#8217;ve found that a light touch can make the real difference between a burger I enjoy eating and one that comes out chewy. Puree the meat while forming the patties, the more compressed and chewy the finished patty will be.</p>
<p>Instead, try to handle the meat as little as possible when forming the patties. Break off large, fist-sized pieces from the minced meat and press them with the palm of your hand on the work surface into coarse patties .Gently tap the edges to give them an even round shape. Don&#8217;t worry if the edges look a little lumpy or cracked; Resist the urge to keep the burgers looking clean and tidy. These blemishes are all in the name of an overly tender burger.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kitchenfoodcompany.com/">Kitchen Food</a> Managing Editor, Christine Gallery, taught us the whole dimple trick and I haven&#8217;t looked back since. Making a shallow indentation in the center of the burger will prevent the burger from shrinking in size and turning brown. in the middle of .After years of small, round burgers, this feels like magic. To make an indentation in your burger, simply use your fingertips to dab the center of the burger patties slightly thinner than the outside edge, maybe half an inch flatter max. .Always think of finished patties as looking like small ones look like frisbees.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>What went wrong? Whoppers cost the Carrols Restaurant Group $8 million in sales.</strong></em></p>
<p>Carrols Restaurant Group is one of the largest <a href="/">Burger King</a> franchisees in the country. It operates more than 1,000 branches out of a total of around 7,500 Burger King branches. an important way. What happened? This is how it happened:Burger King ran a promotion offering discounts on Whopper and Whopper Jr. sandwiches. Most locations offered 2 <a href="https://www.burgerking.co.uk/menu/picker-23d38263-8347-4ddc-aec0-a738c3cc6578">Whopper</a> Jr. for $4, 2 Whopper for $5, and 2 Double Whopper for $6. When customers asked for any of these offerings, the cashier would try to sell them and see if they&#8217;d like to add fries or a drink to their meal.</p>
<p>When a customer bought fries and a drink, an additional &#8220;Whopper Combo Meal&#8221; discount was added alongside the previous Whopper promotion. food.This combination of discounts resulted in an extremely low price for groceries, which severely impacted the profitability of Carrols Restaurant Group.</p>
<p>Because two different promotional discounts were combined when they shouldn&#8217;t have been, Carrols Restaurant Group lost money. A lot of money. After accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the company&#8217;s earnings declined by $7.3 million.</p>
<p>In the quarter in which this incident occurred, Carrols Restaurant Group reported a net loss of $6.8 million (15 cents a share) compared to a net income of $3.6 million in the same quarter last year. The bug was first discovered in late August. Carrols found his store&#8217;s sales increased by just 4%.5%, which was below Burger King&#8217;s overall comparable growth of 5%.</p>
<p>Carrols typically outpaces the growth of other <a href="/mybkexperience-survey/">Burger King</a> franchisees, so they did their research. The problem was discovered in late August and the bug started in early June when the Whopper discount campaign was first launched. It was quickly fixed, but the damage was already done. In total, nearly $8 million in profits were lost as a result of this &#8220;double discount&#8221; on the Burger King Whopper sandwich.</p>
